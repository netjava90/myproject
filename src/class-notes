java is all about classes and objects

java is highly typed language

class is a blue print

object: is and instance of a class

syntax: ClassName objectiveName = new ClassName();

method (function) is reusable block of code that runs when called

class attributes 
		1- variables:
		variableType variableName = VariableValue
		int number1 = 10;
		int number2 = 23;
		
		2-method structure:
		methodType methodName () {code to execute}
		
		method types (int, char, boolean, String, ..etc) 
		void method doesn't exist in variables.
		
		we have two types of methods (1-return methods and 2-non return methods)
		
		parameterisation: method by parameters 
		cToF(23) replace by cToF(int c)
		in the use cal we put (23)
		
		int surface () into int surface (int length, int width)
		replace the value directly in the use cal
		
		hard coded values exm (int length = 3872)
		
		coversion from int to double is done automatically by java and we call it up casting
		
		going from a lower variable type to higher one
		down casting higher variable type to a lower one
		
		generic we can use it for multiple things(cases)
		non generic can be used only one time.
		
		a class vs object (instance)
		fruit vs specific fruit (appl)
		
		constructor vs object
		if taxi is the object, tlc is the constructor (the rules)
		
		we can create multiple constructors but we can have two constructors with the same parameters.
		
		two type of modifiers in java: (access modifiers and non access modifiers)
		
		if the constructor is default we can only access it in the same package.
		build constructor aren't accessible from other packages unless if you make them public
		
		a class can not be private ....the accessibility is about class. 
		class can be public or default only it can't be private
		
		private is related to class
		default is related to package
		protected is related to subclass
		public is everywhere.
